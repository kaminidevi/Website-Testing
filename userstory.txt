Willys varor och varukorg

1.   Som användare vill jag kunna gå till olika kategorier av varor så att
      jag kan se vilka varor som ingår i en kategori (t.ex. Fågel, Tofu etc).

2.  Som användare vill jag kunna klicka på en vara för att få mer information om
    den så att jag kan avgöra om den är intressant för mig.

3.  Som användare vilja kunna lägga till 1 till flera exemplar av en vara
     i varukorg så att jag kan köpa den.

4.  Som användare vill jag kunna se min varukorg och de varor jag har
     lagt i den ska då finnas där så att jag kan köpa dem. 
     
5.  Som användare vill jag att varukorgen räknar rätt så att jag kan se
     totalpriset innan jag väljer att handla.

6.  Som användare vill jag kunna ändra antalet av en vara i    
     varukorgen så att jag kan köpa mer eller mindre av den än vad jag   
     tänkte från början.

7.  Som användare vill jag kunna ta bort en vara från varukorgen så 
     att jag kan ångra att jag har lagt den där.
     
8.  Som användare vill jag kunna tömma hela min varukorg så att jag                               
    kan börja om jag ångrar vad jag lagt i den helt.
